RubyBTeX - a BibTeX replacement written in Ruby

This is a set of Ruby script files that works like BibTeX.
They were developed to produce bibliographies according to
the style for Artificial Life Journal published by the MIT Press.

Two style files are provided: plain and mitalife.  The former
is like BibTeX's plain style (with possible differences).
The latter is the one for ALJ.

I haven't used this for long - Ruby's versions have been changed
many times since I used this.  If you use this, please do so
at your own risk.
